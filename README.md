### Data 
  - decentraland_data
  - user_prediction_data
  - Daily_TxStats.csv

### Analysis
Analysis of the transaciton and user graphs was done in the following Jupyter Notebook:
  - compound_analytics.ipynb
  - Uniswap_daily_transactions.ipynb
  - predicting_users.ipynb

### Helper Function Scripts
Many of the analytic functions are developed in seperate scripts:
  - make_query.py (sends pre-written queries to the graph)
  - queries.py (holds pre-written queries with variable input parameters)
  - visualizations.py (holds functions for graphing and heatmap creation)
  - utils.py (random functions used throughout the project)
  - mining.py (graph mining functions)
  - control.py (functions that control main processes, like analysis segments)
